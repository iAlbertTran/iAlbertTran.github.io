        <p>Hello, thank you for taking the time to visit. 
            I am a 23 year old Software Engineer looking for a full-time opportunity that allows for personal growth and to contribute meaningfully.
            This personal website is meant for you to explore what I am capable of and how I may be an asset to your company. As a software engineer, I always have you, the end user in mind.
            I hope you enjoy your time here.
            <br/> 
            While I currently work with Angular and Node.js to build web applications, I am confident in my abiltiy to pick up any particular tech stack.
            I am mostly looking for roles in web and mobile development. However, I am open to learning about different things.
            <br/>
            I have a wide range of personal interests, including UI / UX design and implementation, 
            artificial intelligence, security, and many more. I plan to touch on each and everyone one of them to gain a better understanding of the direction
            software development may be heading. Ultimately, I aim to develop modern software solutions to every day problems that are constructed elegantly and efficiently.
            Let's have a conversation to find out how we can best fit one another. Please, don't hesitate to contact me!
          </p>
